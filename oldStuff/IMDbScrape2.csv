There are two protagonists - first the title character, Louis XIV, the French sun-king who has two passions, establishing absolute rule over the realm -after decades of religious/civil wars- by divine right and artistic brilliancy as a dancer (like Nero wrote and performed musical poetry), and starts asserting himself against the entourage of his Medici mother, the regent during his minority, by building his palace complex and launching a 'fitting' new, mainly musical display of baroque show. Secondly the musical genius Gianbattista Lulli ('Jean-Baptiste') Lully, a Florentine upstart of unbridled ambition, quickly gains the king's absolute trust, despite the nationalist and aristocratic opposition to a low-born Italian, and thus turns the normally socially humble post of court composer into a 'ministerial portfolio of culture' of Cabinet rank, complete with a monopoly which kills of his artistic rivals in operatic theater. The script also weaves a complex web of court scheming for individual power and social interests, and even a sadistic but accidental murder on a young valet, producing a sensuous and sumptuous drama too complex for this format, ending in a freakish but fatal accident. Louis XIV's mother was Ana de Austria (in French, Anne d' Autriche), the daughter of one of the Hapsburgh Kings of Spain.

Wisconsin Death Trip,1999,Not Rated,Biography Crime Drama History ,,,,"Wisconsin Death Trip is an intimate, shocking and sometimes hilarious account of the disasters that befell one small town in Wisconsin during the final decade of the nineteenth century. The film is inspired by Michael Lesy's book of the same name, which published in 1973. Lesy discovered a striking archive of black and white photographs in the town of Black River Falls, dating from the 1890s and married a selection of these images to extracts from the town's newspaper from the same decade. The effect was surprising and disturbing. The town of Black River Falls seems gripped by some peculiar malaise, and the weekly news is dominated by bizarre tales of madness, eccentricity, and violence amongst the local population. Suicide and murder are commonplace. People in the town are haunted by ghosts, possessed by demons, and terrorized by teenage outlaws and arsonists. Like the book, the film is constructed entirely from authentic news reports from the Black River Falls' newspaper, with occasional excerpts from the records of the nearby Mendota Asylum for the Insane. The film also makes use of the haunting black and white photographs taken by the resident portrait photographer of Black River Falls at the end of the nineteenth century.

Upon reflection, Espen realizes that there is some truth to Johan's words, regardless of his arrogant tone, based on Espen perhaps not being true to himself in what he is writing. As such, he decides to give his in-progress memoirs to the one person who he truly does want to impress, Johan's girlfriend Jenny, to read.

He ended up in the fishing town of Misery Harbour, Newfoundland, where he believed he was truly free for the first time in his life. Despite life in Misery Harbour not being perfect, with his inexperienced self having some woman troubles, he ultimately wanted to escape one more time, from John Wakefield, one of his crew-mates aboard the merchant ship who seemingly double-crossed him while they were crew-mates, and who also ends up in Misery Harbour.

La vuelta de El Coyote,1998,,Adventure Western ,,,,"A Spanish pulp adventure series from the 1940s and 1950s, unabashedly inspired by ""Zorro,"" is the basis for this campy film with a black-masked hero called ""El Coyote."" The leading man here is Jose Coronado, another Spanish heartthrob who does not have the international renown of Antonio Banderas, currently starring in ""The Mask of Zorro."" Both films are set in 19th-century California, but while Zorro fights Spanish oppression, El Coyote takes up arms a bit later in the century, against cruel Americans. California joined the United States in 1850, and the plot's main villain is an American general who plans to steal haciendas from their rightful Hispanic owners, which include El Coyote's family. The film's charm is its attempt to re-create the style of the popular El Coyote pulp series, with grand pronouncements about pure good and pure evil, and scene changes that often look like a melodrama spoof. The endearing international cast includes the British actor Nigel Davenport as the big hacienda owner who criticizes his son for being a wimp without knowing that he is secretly the dashing, hot-blooded ""El Coyote."" The film does not have flashy sword fights like the current ""Zorro"" movie, but it shows that there is more than one way to tell a good adventure yarn.",spaghetti western remake based on novel ,64.0

We see that in those days, the young Rossel was dedicated to his music and to noble sentiments, while Doria is dedicated only to pleasure and to himself. As tension in Spain mounts, culminating in the military takeover by Franco, everyone decides to leave for Spain to fight for freedom. Everyone, that is, except Doria.

Because of the difficulty traveling and the dangers, especially as the landscape is still heavily booby-trapped with mines, Hana volunteers to stay behind at a church to care solely for a dying semi-amnesiac patient, who is badly burned and disfigured. She agrees to catch up to the rest of the unit after he dies. All the patient remembers is that he is English, and that he is married. Their solitude is disrupted with the arrival at the church of fellow Canadian David Caravaggio (Willem Dafoe), part of the Intelligence Service, who is certain that he knows the patient as a man who cooperated with the Germans. Caravaggio believes that the patient's memory is largely intact, and that he is running away from his past, in part, or in its entirety. The patient does open up about his past, all surrounding his work as a cartographer in North Africa, which was interrupted by the war. He may not be running from his work as a spy for the Germans as Caravaggio believes, but rather the memory of an affair he had with married Katharine Clifton (Dame Kristin Scott Thomas), the love of his life, and the memory of a promise not totally fulfilled. Hana may also test her theory of her fates with love and death as she embarks on a relationship of her own with Kip Singh (Naveen Andrews), a Sikh from India, whose unit has camped on the now overgrown lawn of the church. Their work entails sweeping for and diffusing mines, the discovery of one such mine which had earlier saved her life.",patient nurse flashback english church 316 more ,144.0

Dolores, who reassumed her maiden name following the death of Selena's father, Joe St. George, started working as one of Vera's domestics upon her moving permanently into what used to be the Donovans' summer house after Jack Donovan's passing, Dolores ultimately moving into the Donovan house full time as her caregiver when Vera required 'round the clock care. Dolores' employment, which was solely to save money for Selena's education, was despite miserly and overly particular Vera only paying a pittance. Selena has been estranged from Dolores for fifteen years, when Selena went away to college at Vassar on a full scholarship, on Selena's belief not only that her mother killed her father when she was thirteen - the death ultimately ruled accidental - but the trauma she endured at the hands of townsfolk who believed the same in their often anonymous taunts. Selena still suffers emotionally from the trauma, she resorting to various means of self-medication. Detective John Mackey, who led the investigation, believed the same, this case the only blemish in his otherwise perfect career. He, leading the investigation into Vera's death, has seemingly had it in for Dolores for eighteen years, and already has it in his mind that if she could kill Joe, she could just as easily have killed Vera, with a strong underlying motive beyond the seemingly open dislike the two had for each other in their mutual name calling. As Dolores and Selena are forced to move back into what has largely been the closed-up St. George house for however long Selena will be staying on the island, old memories come back to haunt both of them, with the truth behind what happened eighteen years ago and thus what happened with Vera buried deep within those memories in the house.",f rated watching tv woman wears eyeglasses character name as title abuse 115 more ,141.0

A man named Dong-ho is roaming the rural hinterlands, ostensibly to find rare herbal medicines for his employer back in Seoul, but actually in search of Song-hwa, the woman he grew up with. Orphans, they were both apprenticed to the pansori master Yu-bong who pressured them to sacrifice everything for the art. Dong-ho rebelled and ran away, to become the man he is now. Song-hwa stayed, lost her sight, and outlived Yu-bong. Rumor has it that she is still traveling and still singing pansori...

After graduation, she aspires to work in the agency's Behavioral Science Unit under the leadership of Jack Crawford (Scott Glenn). While she is still a trainee, Crawford asks her to question Dr. Hannibal Lecter (Sir Anthony Hopkins), a psychiatrist imprisoned, thus far, for eight years in maximum security isolation for being a serial killer who cannibalized his victims. Clarice is able to figure out the assignment is to pick Lecter's brains to help them solve another serial murder case, that of someone coined by the media as ""Buffalo Bill"" (Ted Levine), who has so far killed five victims, all located in the eastern U.S., all young women, who are slightly overweight (especially around the hips), all who were drowned in natural bodies of water, and all who were stripped of large swaths of skin. She also figures that Crawford chose her, as a woman, to be able to trigger some emotional response from Lecter. After speaking to Lecter for the first time, she realizes that everything with him will be a psychological game, with her often having to read between the very cryptic lines he provides. She has to decide how much she will play along, as his request in return for talking to him is to expose herself emotionally to him. The case takes a more dire turn when a sixth victim is discovered, this one from who they are able to retrieve a key piece of evidence, if Lecter is being forthright as to its meaning. A potential seventh victim is high profile Catherine Martin (Brooke Smith), the daughter of Senator Ruth Martin (Diane Baker), which places greater scrutiny on the case as they search for a hopefully still alive Catherine.

We open the film with a ship finding the craft with our original characters in it, Richard and Emmeline dead and Paddy alive. Established in the first film, the only word Paddy ever says is ""Richard"", so the crew assumes Richard is the infant's name. Taken in by Sarah, a widow with an infant baby girl Lilli, Richard (Paddy) is cared for in a return to civilization. Struck by cholera, the crew of the ship start to die and the captain sets Sarah, Richard, Lilli and a healthy crew member on a lifeboat in an attempt to preserve their lives. With water and food running short, the crew member escorting Sarah and the children becomes dangerous, so Sarah takes the only course of action she feels suitable to preserve the children: she strikes him and throws him overboard. Taking control of the small craft, she eventually guides them back to the island of the first film. The infant Richard, recognizing where he is, finds his home and is very upset not to find his parents. Fixing up the hut and settling in the children, Sarah begins their life on the island, slowly teaching the children survival tools, as well as schooling them as though they were in school, and teaching them slowly about the facts of life, including Lilli's eventual growth to womanhood. When Sarah dies from pneumonia, she leaves the children far more prepared than Richard and Emmeline in the first film. Years later as the children grow into adulthood, the film skims the same themes as the first of their developing relationship, and introduces the characters to civilization when a ship, low on fresh water, stops on their island and offers to take them home. After a confrontation with one of the crew and the captain's daughter, Lilli finds herself pregnant and they decide to stay, as they feel the civilization the visitors have to offer will not compare to the life they lead on the island.",color in title bare breasts island sequel tropical island 47 more ,84.0

The job is not ideal on his side as he has difficulties relating to people which is the reason he has focused on research projects not involving human subjects, while the hospital hires him somewhat out of desperation in not finding anyone else with the qualifications who wants the job. Most of his patients are in a semi-catatonic state and are housed in what some of the orderlies coin the ""garden"" ward, where all they can do for the patients is water and feed them. He notices that some of the patients, despite their generally catatonic state, respond in unusual ways to certain stimuli. In doing some research, he also finds that some common bonds between these patients are that they suffered from encephalitis in the 1920s or 1930s, and that their physical states are like they have Parkinson's disease frozen in time. As such, he is able to convince, albeit reluctantly, his skeptical boss, Dr. Kaufman, to administer an expensive experimental drug therapy on only one patient with family consent. That patient is forty-one year old Leonard Lowe, who has been in his current state since he was eleven years old, and who has been supported by his loving mother through all these years. As the drug therapy ""awakens"" Leonard, there are several issues that come into play. Malcolm has to try and convince Kaufman and the hospital administration to extend the therapy to the other patients. Despite not knowing the long term effects, Leonard, who was aware of his surroundings through his catatonic state, may have mixed emotions about his situation, wanting both to be treated as human being and an experiment guinea pig to ensure that what is happening benefits him and others in the long run. Mrs. Lowe may be unprepared for the new Leonard, she expecting who she remembers as a sweet eleven year old boy.

His wife, Barbara Sabich, has been struggling with focus on completing her Ph.D. dissertation in Mathemetics - a thus far ten year process - she who nonetheless is applying for a college teaching position. They are generally in a loving, supportive marriage, Barbara who seems to have gotten over Rusty's infidelity with his colleague Carolyn Polhemus, an Assistant Prosecuting Attorney. Carolyn is ambitious, she who, in part, used Rusty to try and climb up the ladder. Barbara will still throw the issue of Carolyn in his face whenever there are problems between the two. Rusty and Carolyn's affair is unknown to others in their personal and professional circles. Rusty is handed the most personal case of his career when his boss and mentor, Chief Prosecuting Attorney Raymond Horgan, assigns him the case to discover who killed Carolyn, her dead body found in her apartment in what looks initially to be a violent rape, with Carolyn eventually strangled and no sign of forced entry, leading to the belief her killer was whoever her lover or possibly someone she prosecuted. Raymond, who is in a difficult reelection campaign, wants a quick resolution to the investigation, as ""finding the killer"" will greatly increase his chances of getting reelected. Rusty tries to dissuade Raymond from giving him the case because of the affair of which Raymond is unaware, with Rusty eventually having no choice but to accept barring disclosure of the affair. As Rusty proceeds with the investigation, he takes steps to hide the affair largely to protect Barbara and their adolescent son, Nat Sabich. Those measures come back to bite him when they and other evidence collected by the police lead to him being charged for Carolyn's murder. Rusty hires Sandy Stern, one of his toughest adversaries in a number of previous cases. During the court proceedings, many involved do whatever they can protect their own interest regardless of the truth. Beyond Rusty being convicted or acquitted, a question thus becomes if the truth matters or if the murderer will ever be discovered.",adultery neo noir woman murders a woman 5th amendment scene of the crime 113 more ,127.0

When her husband tells her it is her duty to serve the king and give in to his wishes, she goes to the king, but makes it very clear that she despises him and doesn't return his love for her. The king's passion for Jeanne never subsides and eventually goes so far that he loses a war when he returns home to nurse her through a near fatal illness instead of remaining with his troops and leading them in battle. Throughout the film the king becomes increasingly frustrated with the subservience of his court and people, who see it as their duty to serve and please him in every way: no courtier will be better at swordsmanship than the king, or at dancing, or at playing music, while the only person he desires makes it very clear that she will only bend to his wishes under pressure and against her will.",sword fight refusal obsessive love fatal attraction period drama 16 more ,115.0

While perhaps not as entertaining to a person unfamiliar with Finnish traditions, the brilliant acting, directing, plus the warm, beautiful Finnish summer more than make up for the cultural gap. The story begins with a group of brothers with their families coming up to honour the memory of their recently deceased father. Spending time together, opening old wounds and creating new ones... it all boils down to brotherhood. No matter what happens, brothers take care of their own. Considering that the events of the movie all take place within a 24 hour period, nothing feels too rushed. The film rolls on naturally, and at least for yours truly there was not a single dull minute. The best part about this film is the cast that they managed to put together for the movie. Esko Salminen, Taneli Mäkelä, Vesa Vierikko and Esko Nikkari are all well-known, extremely talented Finnish actors, but this movie contains among the best performances of their careers. Especially Mäkelä and Nikkari are brilliant; Mäkelä's quiet and contemplative character has depth that you can just feel...and Nikkari's portrayal of a town drunk is so convincing, you would not believe that it is merely an act.

Along with him on the working staff are a samurai straight out of the history books, a G.I. from World War II, and several other anachronistic characters. Among the patrons are a bike rider named Bluce Springsteen, Hurry Carahan (a cop who is a gangster once in awhile), and other types who may be gangsters in disguise. The plot (as such) revolves around keeping away the brutal mobsters and thugs who dominate the city streets outside of the bar, making the tavern safe for its easily recognized facsimiles of well-known characters. ~ Eleanor Mannikka, All Movie Guide",detective based on novel character name in title ,60.0

Middle-aged Edward is the friendly head of the household. He's been drinking heavily as of recently, and not just because he has a problem with the stuff. His still very attractive wife Charlotte has become a bit of an introvert recently and spends most of her time in the nursery garden, since that's their main source of income these days. Their niece Ottilie Garinger, a pretty young woman who's been living with them ever since her parents died in a car accident, is very glad that there's someone new in their lives and just wants to escape the miserable passionless existence that their family life has become. There's also little Michael, of whom Masters knows nothing about. Masters begins to enjoy the countryside and works less and less. Ottilie almost immediately falls for him, and although they do start a sexual relationship, he remains very reserved towards her emotionally, since he's actually more interested in the lady of the house - Mrs. Lawless.

Because the context of these wisdoms is not always evident, they mainly embody the lonely madness in which the protagonist finds himself. In short, Bernd is an anarchist maverick, who goes through life unhindered by any responsibility or regulation. From that background he decides on a rainy, hangover day to take his supposed daughter Walijne (Tara Fallaux) to the beach of Scheveningen. The slightly disabled girl lives with her mother Medusa (Helen Hedy) and her new boyfriend Carl (Emile Fallaux). When they need a nanny, all they can do is ask Bernd to take the girl under his wing for the day. Once on the beach he takes good care of Walijne, until the drink again takes its toll. In her childhood innocence, Walijne initially looks up to the man, but when he repeatedly loses the girl, Bernd risks that affection. However, the sad and lonely alcoholic continues to drink hard, near to destruction. The fact that ""A day at the beach"" does not become an excessively tragic drama is due to the ironic nature of the film. It is an irony that rubs against the absurd. Bernd's encounters with other beach and café visitors are far from everyday. The matching piano music also contributes to that atmosphere. It keeps the film delicious and the attention for the increasingly unfriendly Bernd intact.",based on novel ,60.0

The rest of the world sees the Greasers as all the same, the face being Dallas Winston, the most volatile one who has just been released from prison, despite each boy having his own specific view of life. Similarly, the world sees the Socs, the Greasers' primary rivals, as all the same, rich spoiled entitled boys with a sense of superiority from the south side of town, despite again each boy being his own person. A connection between the two gangs happens in the form of Ponyboy and Cherry Valance, which doesn't sit well with Cherry's Soc boyfriend, Bob Sheldon. As a result, an incident occurs involving the Socs, Ponyboy and fellow Greaser, sixteen-year-old Johnny Cade, an equally sensitive boy who wants a better life for himself, but seems stuck in a downward spiral with parents who don't give him the time of day. Beyond Ponyboy and Johnny's lives being threatened by that incident, the Greasers and the Socs agree to a rumble to settle things once and for all. Some of the boys realize the rumble will accomplish nothing, with the questions being if they can convince their colleagues of the same, and if not what the consequences will be.",gang rivalry 1960s dysfunctional family male objectification 248 more ,60.0

When the superhuman generation Nexus 6 replicants, used for dangerous off-Earth endeavors, began a mutiny on an off-Earth colony, replicants became illegal on Earth. Police units, called ""blade runners"", have the job of destroying - or in their parlance ""retiring"" - any replicant that makes its way back to or created on Earth, with anyone convicted of aiding or assisting a replicant being sentenced to death. It's now November, 2019 in Los Angeles, California. Rick Deckard, a former blade runner, is called out of retirement when four known replicants, most combat models, have made their way back to Earth, with their leader being Roy Batty. One, Leon Kowalski, tried to infiltrate his way into the Tyrell Corporation as an employee, but has since been able to escape. Beyond following Leon's trail in hopes of finding and retiring them all, Deckard believes part of what will help him is figuring out what the replicants wanted with the Tyrell Corporation in trying to infiltrate it. The answer may lie with Tyrell's fail-safe backup mechanism. Beyond tracking the four, Deckard faces a possible dilemma in encountering a fifth replicant: Rachael, who works as Tyrell's assistant. The issue is that Dr. Elden Tyrell is experimenting with her, to provide her with fake memories so as to be able to better control her. With those memories, Rachael has no idea that she is not human. The problem is not only Rachael's assistance to Deckard, but that he is beginning to develop feelings for her.",tech noir cyberpunk police detective human android relationship female android 277 more ,60.0

An incident early in his career in which he was trying to do the right thing led to him being fired from the prestigious law firm with which he was working, almost being disbarred, and his wife leaving him. Continually drowning his sorrows in booze, he is now an ambulance-chasing lawyer, preying on the weak and vulnerable, and bending the truth whenever necessary to make what few dollars he has, as he has only had a few cases in the last few years, losing the last four. His only friend in the profession is his now retired ex-partner, Mickey Morrissey, who gets Frank a case, his fee solely a percentage of what his clients are awarded. The case should net Frank tens of thousands of dollars by settling out of court, that money which would at least get him back on his feet. It is a negligence suit brought on behalf of Deborah Ann Kaye by her sister and brother-in-law, Sally and Kevin Doneghy, against St. Catherine Labouré Hospital, operated by the Archdiocese of Boston, and Drs. Towler and Marks. Kaye was admitted to the hospital for what should have been a routine delivery, but something that happened while Kaye was on the operating room table led to her brain being deprived of oxygen, resulting in permanent brain damage, and Kaye now being in a totally vegetative state requiring hospitalization for the rest of her life. Frank eventually learns that the cause seems to be that Dr. Towler, the anesthesiologist and an expert in the field, used the incorrect anesthetic for the situation. However, all but one person that was in the operating room that day has provided depositions that nothing improper occurred in the operating room. The one holdout is the operating room head nurse, Maureen Rooney, who is not talking, period, to Frank or the other side. Upon seeing the state Kaye is in, Frank unilaterally decides to do what he believes is the right thing by declining the lucrative out-of-court settlement offered by the Archdiocese and take the case to court. In doing so, he hopes the truth that the hospital and the doctors truly were negligent comes to light. Feeling that this case may be a turning point in his life, Frank has a new spring in his step, enough that he attracts the attention of Laura Fischer, the two who begin a relationship. Despite having whatever the truth is on his side, that truth which he does not know, and having an expert witness of his own, Frank has an uphill battle in that the Archdiocese has retained the services of Ed Concannon, a high-priced lawyer who has a large team of associates whose task is to help Concannon and the Archdiocese win at any cost.

Boldyn,1982,,Biography Drama History War ,,,,"Second World War, occupied Poland. Somewhere in the woods near the town of Bialystok, a partisan group, commanded by a self-proclaimed General Boldyn, is stationed. The commander demands total obedience and cannot bear objections or criticism. Moreover, he shows signs of mental disorders, sometimes hardly discerning the reality from his dreams. Seeking relaxation, he hits the bottle, but this only makes things worse as he starts hallucinating. General Boldyn cannot stand idleness - it makes his autocratic tendencies grow even stronger. In order to avoid it, his subordinates start to provide him with false reports on sudden moves of German troops. The resulting decisions of the General prove wrong; a disaster becomes inevitable. ""Boldyn"" is more a psychological movie rather than a war story - it's focused more on relations between the commander and his subordinates, and the General's internal struggle with himself, than on the history of the time. There are only a few battle scenes throughout the movie, and in general the war appears more like a ""stage design"" than a component of the story. Despite being made in 1981 and based on a novel by a writer who belonged to the top brass of People's Republic of Poland, the movie is not burdened with a propaganda layer - neither the general nor the partisans are idealized, and heroism mingles with trickery and lack of moral values.",f rated power polish history polish army poland 7 more ,60.0

The story centers around Prokop, a scrupulous scientist responsible for the invention of a highly-efficient explosive who, foreseeing the consequences of his invention once in the hands of those in power, spins into delirium as he faces the moral dilemma presented by his secret, then the crushing guilt and regret for his role in releasing such a potent tool of mass destruction unto the world, and the inevitable catastrophe that follows. The novel presaged the atomic age by two decades and even anticipated, three decades prior, the same deep ethical remorse that J.R. Oppenheimer, a ""father of the atomic bomb"", would later bring to public attention (ending in the revocation of all his security clearances). The themes presented in this 1981 remake are still very relevant, then and now, and its urgency is still fresh.",two word title explosive remake czech remake remake of czech film 28 more ,120.0

Moses fell into work as a private investigator of the gumshoe variety, which usually doesn't cover his monthly child support payments. After not seeing her for ten years, Moses is contacted by Lila Shea, an old girlfriend from Berkeley, to do some investigative work on behalf of her boss, Sam Sebastian, the Southern California coordinator for the gubernatorial campaign of Congressman Miles Hawthorne. Lila felt Moses would be well suited to the job because of running within ""the"" crowd at Berkeley, even if only knowing the main players by name and reputation. Flyers have been circulating with a doctored photo of Hawthorne and Howard Eppis in a friendly embrace, Eppis who in the late 1960s was part of the California 4 - the other three being Michael and Wendy Linker, and Luis Vasquez - an anti-establishment group convicted of several counts related to their work against the government. While the Linkers are behind bars probably for the rest of their lives, Luis Vasquez is a free man working for the rights of Mexican laborers, while Eppis has been a fugitive ever since, the authorities who are still looking for him. The flyers, which contain extreme socialist rhetoric and an implication of Hawthorne welcoming Eppis' endorsement, have the potential to derail Hawthorne's campaign. Moses is tasked with finding out who is behind the flyers - the most obvious being the campaign of Hawthorne's competitor, Senator Dillworthy - and if it is indeed not Eppis, why they would have specifically used Eppis' name. Moses accepts the job despite not endorsing Hawthorne - or Dillworthy for that matter - he equating Hawthorne's excitement factor to watching paint dry. The further Moses and Lila get into the investigation, the number of unanswered questions they have grows, and the more people who were associated with Eppis at the time cannot be located, including Oscar Procari, Jr., who funded the California 4's defense probably to spite his industrialist father.

Carrie,1976,R,Horror Mystery ,"1,800,000 (estimated)","33,800,000","33,800,000","It's nearing the end of the school year. High school senior Carrie White is a social outcast, largely due to being unwise to the ways of the world based on her upbringing. Her mother, Margaret White, is a religious fanatic, her extreme views primarily targeted against sex, which she believes is a sin. She even believes natural associated processes such as menstruation are a sin, about which she has refused to mention to Carrie. Mrs. White's beliefs were taken to that extreme largely because of her own failed marriage and her husband Ralph long ago having run off with another woman. The only adult authority figure who tries to help Carrie with her life is her phys ed teacher, Miss Collins, who is nonetheless warned not to get too close to go against how Mrs. White chooses to raise Carrie, Mrs. White whose beliefs are well known in the community. An impromptu event that happens among Carrie's phys ed classmates against her leads to her classmates being punished. One of those students, self absorbed Chris Hargensen, vows revenge against Carrie for that punishment, the method of the revenge associated to the phys ed class incident. Another student however, the popular Sue Snell, begins to feel sorry for Carrie. In wanting to help her get out of her shell, Sue asks her boyfriend, the equally popular Tommy Ross, to take Carrie to the senior prom instead of her. This move does not sit well with Mrs. White, who in her extreme view believes Carrie will fall prey to sin. All these competing issues lead to Carrie deciding on an impulse to use a newfound skill to free herself from the figurative chains that have long been placed around her, with tragic consequences.",telekinesis high school prom prank bad mother female protagonist 726 more ,60.0

Nevertheless, detective Blackstone accepts the task to train the rookie. Ironically, they both have things they could learn from one another as they have different approaches to solving problems. At the same time, their squad is after a notorious drug dealer and illegal weapons trafficker named Thomas 'Stick' Henderson. This case is assigned to a skilled undercover female detective named Patty Butler. She plans to ingratiate herself with Henderson in the hope that he will court her, become her lover and entrust her with his secrets concerning his criminal activities. Her suggestion is met with reluctance by her superiors who fear that she could get killed and make the department look bad. Not to mention the fact they could lose their jobs or pensions. However, detective Patty Butler persuades them to give her permission for her plan. They agree, but they warn her not to fall in love with him for real. Promising to be professional, Patty Butler gets to work. The real tragedy occurs when rookie Beauregard Lockley notices Patty Butler on the streets and is attracted to her without knowing who she is. No one from the squad informs Lockley that Patty Butler is a cop, for fear of blowing her cover. But Lockley often thinks about her. When Patty fails to contact her superiors and disappears for more than two weeks, the squad superiors send rookie Lockley to look for her without telling him who she is. They only tell him that the girl is a person of interest to the police and that her nickname is 'Chicklet'. When Lockley finds her, he realizes that she is the attractive girl he has previously seen on the streets while training with his veteran partner. Lockley is determined to save 'Chicklet' from her criminal boyfriend, still not knowing that she's an undercover cop on assignment. Lockley follows her, talks to her and tries to take her away with him. However, Patty Butler aka 'Chicklet' is determined to finish her undercover assignment. She refuses to go with Lockley or to reveal to him her real identity. She only promises to secretly meet him the next day in a pub. Lockley informs his superiors he found 'Chicklet' but they tell him to forget all about her. Unfazed, detective Lockley goes to her 'boyfriend's' apartment in Times Square and that's where the first tragedy strikes. Furthermore, a chase on foot ensues and a Mexican stand-off in an elevator of the Saks Fifth Avenue department store occurs. That's the second tragedy.

Osadeni dushi,1975,,Drama Romance War ,,,,"This is an epic and dramatic film about the social tragedy of the Spanish Revolution.

The accidental meeting of British noblewoman Fanny Horn with Father Eredia, a Jesuit monk, reverses their destinies. The attraction between them is very strong, yet the monk is fanatically devoted to his faith. Influenced by his religious strength, Fanny Horn follows him to a place where a typhus outbreak is raging. Pena Ronda is a camp for typhoid patients. The conditions are horrible, and the death is creeping around them. The shadows of the terminally ill move silently amid the rusty barbed-wire fences and the hospital shacks while on the outside the people of Spain are being drowned in blood. Against the background of this inferno, a passionate crime is committed. It is the work of English aristocrat Fanny who is in love with her victim-priest Eredia. There are many reasons for this personal drama: the burning tears of the Revolution, the chimera of death haunting the place and, above all, the degradation of the priest who has turned from an inspired idealist into a fanatical lunatic. Befuddled by the sterile canons of his religion, Eredia sinks into the hermetic world of his lunacy and is humiliatingly detached from the sufferings of ordinary people and his own nation.

Regardless, famed and fastidious Belgian detective, Hercule Poirot, who needs to get back to London immediately, is able to secure last minute passage in the compartment with the assistance of his friend, Signor Bianchi, one of the directors of the train line who is also making the trip. Some of the first class passengers seem concerned about Poirot's presence on the train. At least one of them has reason to be concerned, as later, another first class passenger, who earlier in the trip asked Poirot to provide protection for him due to several death threats, is found murdered in his stateroom by multiple stabbings. At the time the victim is found, the train is unexpectedly stopped and delayed due to snow in remote Yugoslavia, which may be problematic for the murderer in getting away now that Poirot is on the case, which he is doing as a favor to Bianchi as not to get the Yugoslav police involved. Poirot quickly learns that the victim was not who he presented himself to be and has a connection to a five-year-old American kidnapping and murder case of infant Daisy Armstrong, murdered in spite of the fact that her parents had paid the requested ransom. The murderer in that case has long been convicted and executed but the ransom moneys were never recovered, a known accomplice never captured, and both the Armstrong parents have since tragically died. As Poirot questions the train's valet, the victim's accompanying staff, and the other primarily well off first class passengers and their accompanying servants, who are all on the surface more than cooperative, he finds that many had opportunity and motive, the latter which may not be obvious. There is also a great deal of evidence discovered on the train, which pulls his thoughts in many directions.

The island is inhabited exclusively by blacks. He quickly learns that his students, who have never left the island, lack not only a basic understanding of academic items such as the alphabet and simple arithmetic, but also of other basic necessities of life such as personal hygiene. They can't even pronounce his name, they who call him Conrack. The teachers before him, including the school principal Mrs. Scott, have always treated the students as being slow and basically unteachable of academics. Conrack, a free thinking man, decides to expose his students not only to the academic subjects, but also to the gamut of life skills from brushing one's teeth to human anatomy, and some of the fun things in life like classical music, art, baseball, movies, swimming (despite living on an island, the islanders live in fear of the river because they don't know how to swim), and Halloween.
