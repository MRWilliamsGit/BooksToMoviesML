While perhaps not as entertaining to a person unfamiliar with Finnish traditions, the brilliant acting, directing, plus the warm, beautiful Finnish summer more than make up for the cultural gap. The story begins with a group of brothers with their families coming up to honour the memory of their recently deceased father. Spending time together, opening old wounds and creating new ones... it all boils down to brotherhood. No matter what happens, brothers take care of their own. Considering that the events of the movie all take place within a 24 hour period, nothing feels too rushed. The film rolls on naturally, and at least for yours truly there was not a single dull minute. The best part about this film is the cast that they managed to put together for the movie. Esko Salminen, Taneli Mäkelä, Vesa Vierikko and Esko Nikkari are all well-known, extremely talented Finnish actors, but this movie contains among the best performances of their careers. Especially Mäkelä and Nikkari are brilliant; Mäkelä's quiet and contemplative character has depth that you can just feel...and Nikkari's portrayal of a town drunk is so convincing, you would not believe that it is merely an act.

Among the patrons are a bike rider named Bluce Springsteen, Hurry Carahan (a cop who is a gangster once in awhile), and other types who may be gangsters in disguise. The plot (as such) revolves around keeping away the brutal mobsters and thugs who dominate the city streets outside of the bar, making the tavern safe for its easily recognized facsimiles of well-known characters. ~ Eleanor Mannikka, All Movie Guide",detective based on novel character name in title ,60

The triad also has an unofficial agreement with the Italian mafia, still seen as the major player in organized crime in the city, to be cooperative in a win-win situation in their illegal activities. However, the Chinese youth gangs are disregarding these unofficial agreements, being another violent player in the crime scene in Chinatown, they who take a stand by killing Jackie Wong, the head of the triad. To deal with the matter, the NYPD reassign Captain Stanley White from Brooklyn to Chinatown. Stanley, of Polish heritage, is not averse to slinging slurs toward his adversaries, most of those of a racial nature. This reassignment will not help the already deteriorating marriage he has to his long suffering wife, Connie. While Stanley is supposed to target his efforts against the youth gangs, he instead decides to target his efforts against Joey Tai, Jackie's son-in-law who has taken over the triad. Stanley's actions do not sit well with his superiors who want to honor their long held tradition of leaving the triad alone. Although Joey convinced the triad elders that they needed a more vigorous leadership which he could accomplish, Joey, in reality, may have more to do with the increased violence in Chinatown than they realize, including Jackie's murder. In achieving his goal, Stanley co-opts the assistance of Herbert Kwong, a neophyte NYPD officer to go undercover to infiltrate Joey's organization, a job for which his training may make him ill-prepared.

Because the context of these wisdoms is not always evident, they mainly embody the lonely madness in which the protagonist finds himself. In short, Bernd is an anarchist maverick, who goes through life unhindered by any responsibility or regulation. From that background he decides on a rainy, hangover day to take his supposed daughter Walijne (Tara Fallaux) to the beach of Scheveningen. The slightly disabled girl lives with her mother Medusa (Helen Hedy) and her new boyfriend Carl (Emile Fallaux). When they need a nanny, all they can do is ask Bernd to take the girl under his wing for the day. Once on the beach he takes good care of Walijne, until the drink again takes its toll. In her childhood innocence, Walijne initially looks up to the man, but when he repeatedly loses the girl, Bernd risks that affection. However, the sad and lonely alcoholic continues to drink hard, near to destruction. The fact that ""A day at the beach"" does not become an excessively tragic drama is due to the ironic nature of the film. It is an irony that rubs against the absurd. Bernd's encounters with other beach and café visitors are far from everyday. The matching piano music also contributes to that atmosphere.

When the superhuman generation Nexus 6 replicants, used for dangerous off-Earth endeavors, began a mutiny on an off-Earth colony, replicants became illegal on Earth. Police units, called ""blade runners"", have the job of destroying - or in their parlance ""retiring"" - any replicant that makes its way back to or created on Earth, with anyone convicted of aiding or assisting a replicant being sentenced to death. It's now November, 2019 in Los Angeles, California. Rick Deckard, a former blade runner, is called out of retirement when four known replicants, most combat models, have made their way back to Earth, with their leader being Roy Batty. One, Leon Kowalski, tried to infiltrate his way into the Tyrell Corporation as an employee, but has since been able to escape. Beyond following Leon's trail in hopes of finding and retiring them all, Deckard believes part of what will help him is figuring out what the replicants wanted with the Tyrell Corporation in trying to infiltrate it. The answer may lie with Tyrell's fail-safe backup mechanism. Beyond tracking the four, Deckard faces a possible dilemma in encountering a fifth replicant: Rachael, who works as Tyrell's assistant. The issue is that Dr. Elden Tyrell is experimenting with her, to provide her with fake memories so as to be able to better control her. With those memories, Rachael has no idea that she is not human.

An incident early in his career in which he was trying to do the right thing led to him being fired from the prestigious law firm with which he was working, almost being disbarred, and his wife leaving him. Continually drowning his sorrows in booze, he is now an ambulance-chasing lawyer, preying on the weak and vulnerable, and bending the truth whenever necessary to make what few dollars he has, as he has only had a few cases in the last few years, losing the last four. His only friend in the profession is his now retired ex-partner, Mickey Morrissey, who gets Frank a case, his fee solely a percentage of what his clients are awarded. The case should net Frank tens of thousands of dollars by settling out of court, that money which would at least get him back on his feet. It is a negligence suit brought on behalf of Deborah Ann Kaye by her sister and brother-in-law, Sally and Kevin Doneghy, against St. Catherine Labouré Hospital, operated by the Archdiocese of Boston, and Drs. Towler and Marks. Kaye was admitted to the hospital for what should have been a routine delivery, but something that happened while Kaye was on the operating room table led to her brain being deprived of oxygen, resulting in permanent brain damage, and Kaye now being in a totally vegetative state requiring hospitalization for the rest of her life. Frank eventually learns that the cause seems to be that Dr. Towler, the anesthesiologist and an expert in the field, used the incorrect anesthetic for the situation. However, all but one person that was in the operating room that day has provided depositions that nothing improper occurred in the operating room. The one holdout is the operating room head nurse, Maureen Rooney, who is not talking, period, to Frank or the other side. Upon seeing the state Kaye is in, Frank unilaterally decides to do what he believes is the right thing by declining the lucrative out-of-court settlement offered by the Archdiocese and take the case to court. In doing so, he hopes the truth that the hospital and the doctors truly were negligent comes to light. Feeling that this case may be a turning point in his life, Frank has a new spring in his step, enough that he attracts the attention of Laura Fischer, the two who begin a relationship. Despite having whatever the truth is on his side, that truth which he does not know, and having an expert witness of his own, Frank has an uphill battle in that the Archdiocese has retained the services of Ed Concannon, a high-priced lawyer who has a large team of associates whose task is to help Concannon and the Archdiocese win at any cost.

Boldyn,1982,,Biography Drama History War ,,,,"Second World War, occupied Poland. Somewhere in the woods near the town of Bialystok, a partisan group, commanded by a self-proclaimed General Boldyn, is stationed. The commander demands total obedience and cannot bear objections or criticism. Moreover, he shows signs of mental disorders, sometimes hardly discerning the reality from his dreams. Seeking relaxation, he hits the bottle, but this only makes things worse as he starts hallucinating. General Boldyn cannot stand idleness - it makes his autocratic tendencies grow even stronger. In order to avoid it, his subordinates start to provide him with false reports on sudden moves of German troops. The resulting decisions of the General prove wrong; a disaster becomes inevitable. ""Boldyn"" is more a psychological movie rather than a war story - it's focused more on relations between the commander and his subordinates, and the General's internal struggle with himself, than on the history of the time. There are only a few battle scenes throughout the movie, and in general the war appears more like a ""stage design"" than a component of the story. Despite being made in 1981 and based on a novel by a writer who belonged to the top brass of People's Republic of Poland, the movie is not burdened with a propaganda layer - neither the general nor the partisans are idealized, and heroism mingles with trickery and lack of moral values.",f rated power polish history polish army poland 7 more ,60

An incident between the two which on the surface threatens to tear them even further apart instead blossoms into a friendship between the two.

The story centers around Prokop, a scrupulous scientist responsible for the invention of a highly-efficient explosive who, foreseeing the consequences of his invention once in the hands of those in power, spins into delirium as he faces the moral dilemma presented by his secret, then the crushing guilt and regret for his role in releasing such a potent tool of mass destruction unto the world, and the inevitable catastrophe that follows. The novel presaged the atomic age by two decades and even anticipated, three decades prior, the same deep ethical remorse that J.R. Oppenheimer, a ""father of the atomic bomb"", would later bring to public attention (ending in the revocation of all his security clearances). The themes presented in this 1981 remake are still very relevant, then and now, and its urgency is still fresh.",two word title explosive remake czech remake remake of czech film 28 more ,120

Alex denies the request, but Proteus IV does find an open terminal in the Harris home after Alex has left the house. Susan soon learns that Proteus IV has overtaken Alfred for control of the house - as well as taken control of an early prototype computer system named Joshua in the house's laboratory - and that it has thoughts of a biological nature in its artificial mind. Alex eventually understands Proteus IV's motivations in the work context, but it may be too late before it reaches its ultimate goal with Susan's unwilling assistance.",childbirth voyeur computer scientist house 55 more ,60
